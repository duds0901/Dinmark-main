        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>The predominant climate in Denmark is oceanic tropical, characterized by temperatures ranging from cold and rainfall well distributed throughout the year. <br> This position results in cold summers with temperatures around 16°C and not so cold winters with temperatures around 0°C. Therefore, Denmark is in a temperate climate zone. <br> 
            There is a strong presence of strong winds during the winter and weaker during the summer. There is precipitation throughout the year, with the rainiest months being September, October and November, while February and April have the lowest rainfall. <br>    
            Within the Danish region, there are small variations in temperature from one location to another. During winter, the lowest temperatures are found in areas further away from the sea. In summer, the highest temperatures are found in southern Zealand and the Lolland-Falster region. Coastal regions experience little temperature variation between summer and winter due to the equalizing effect of the sea. <br>

 The Danish climate shows variations according to changes in the global climate system. Viewed over a long period of time, the temperature in Denmark has never been constant. Cold spells replaced warm spells, and large variations in climate are indicated by glacial or interglacial periods.</p>
